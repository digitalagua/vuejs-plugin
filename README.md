Vue.js Support for the Intellij Platform (WebStorm, PhpStorm, Rubymine, Intellij, etc)

# Install
You can install it via Settings -> Plugins -> Browse repositories -> (search for) Vue.js

Or download it from here and install it manually:

# Contributing
This project is still a work in progress.  I welcome ideas and additions.  My goal is to make it have similar functionality and features as the [angularjs-plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-plugins/tree/master/AngularJS).
